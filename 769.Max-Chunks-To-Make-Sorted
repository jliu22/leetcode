/*
Given an array arr that is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1], we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk.  After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

Example 1:

Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
Note:

arr will have length in range [1, 10].
arr[i] will be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1].

// index i can represent current value because the array is [0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1]
// find current max which equal to index i, means all the left side of index i are smaller than current max
// then current i is a split point
// another idea is start from end to 0, if arr[i+1] is smaller than arr[i], then set arr[i+1] = arr[i]
// means set the value of right side to the max of current, then result is count of different value in the array

class Solution {
public:
    int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr) {
        if (arr.empty()) return 0;

        int count = 0, cmax = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            cmax = std::max(cmax, arr[i]);
            if (cmax == i) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
