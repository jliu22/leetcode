/*
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
Note:

This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
